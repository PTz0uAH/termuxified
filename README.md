Welcome Termux devs, students & teachers..

"Termuxified" means "adapted for usage with Termux"

Current project: FreePascal v3.2.2 (stable) for Termux

"Termuxified" builds:
- fpc-3.2.2.arm-termux.deb (available)
- fpcsrc-3.2.2.arm-termux.deb (available)
- fpcmkcfg-3.2.2.arm-termux.deb (available)
- fpcsrc-3.2.2.aarch64-termux.deb (available)
- fpc-3.2.2.aarch64-termux.deb (wip)

Coming soon/wishlist:
- fpc-3.x.cross-amiga.deb
- lazarus4termux (X11) on XFCE4 desktop (Integrated Development Environment)
- cge4termux (X11) on XFCE4 desktop (Castle Game Engine)
- and more..

Todo:
- compiling the build-tool of CGE did not yet succeed.. help wanted! 

note: because I'm not using LFS or seperate hosting for bigger deb-files you are strongly adviced (when "cloning" my repo) the option "--depth 1" should be used to ignore debs from history which can slow down the download-process significantly!

With kind regards,

ergo:
- "Oldskool" Delphi/Pascal minded "Ãœbergeeks" should be able to build a functional FPC-3.3.1 aarch64-android dev environment from trunk incl. fixing bugs freepascal.org devs forgot/ignored/missed/left.. IYKWIM!
- IT-Academics should be able to native-build a FPC AARCH64 distri/deb for Termux AARCH64 from scratch..
- IT-Students should be able to native-build a FPC ARM distr/deb for Termux ARM from scratch..
- ICT-students would depend on non-from-scratch-tools like fpcupdeluxe or preconfigured OOTB packages which are not (yet) available for arm|aarch64-android..
