Welcome Termux devs, students & teachers..

"Termuxified" means "adapted for usage with Termux"

Current experimental project: FPCUPDELUXE v2.4.0fp from trunk
- minor code changes..
- 100% native no crosscompiling..
- build with lazbuild..
- it runs and I managed to create a working FPC & LAZARUS..
- that took some effort but lets make it work better..
- please just post bugs at issues..
- usage at own risk!
