Welcome Termux devs, students & teachers..

"Termuxified" means "adapted for usage with Termux"

Another challenge conquered.. building the latest Amiberry for Android from trunk!

- minor code changes, original source at (https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry)..
- Just clone my Amiberry fork at (https://github.com/PTz0uAH/amiberry) and have fun building..
- All changes from the original are committed..
- 100% native on-device, no crosscompiling
- built on 64-bit TERMUX/X11/XFCE4
- Amiberry starts up with the GUI and was tested briefly(no bugs yet)
- It is so cool to have Amiberry running on Android 13 via Termux..
- Please just post bugs and relevant issues overhere.

known bugs:
- amiberry just starts from the parent directory of the build folder..
- it runs slow and the sound is tuned down.. though not choppy..

todo:
- find a way to compile the executable location independent..
- make use of 8 cores during the slow build process..
- see issues

with kind regards,

PTz(Peter Slootbeek)uAH
