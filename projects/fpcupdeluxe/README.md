Welcome Termux devs, students & teachers..

"Termuxified" means "adapted for usage with Termux"

Here you can find the experimental build of FPCUPDELUXE v2.4.0fp from trunk
- minor code changes, original source at https://github.com/LongDirtyAnimAlf/fpcupdeluxe
- 100% native on-device, no crosscompiling
- built with lazbuild
- it runs and was tested to create fpc and lazarus from trunk (lots of bugs to conquer)
- so lets make it work and please just post bugs at issues
- usage at own risk!
- 
- with kind regards,
- PTz(Peter Slootbeek)uAH
