Welcome Termux devs..

"Termuxified" means "adapted for usage with Termux"

The FPC-3.2.2 Core-Utility "fpcmkcfg" standalone edition is primarely intended to be used getting incomplete freepascal.org arm/aarch64-android distris functional again..

Usage-at-own-risk: FPCMKCFG v3.2.2 is fully functional, full source included in seperate "fpcsrc" package! 

note: might also work in aarch64-android but for Termux we prefer the single-architecture approach..

With kind regards,

PTz()uAH

hint: a fpc.cfg generated with fpcmkcfg (arm) also works for aarch64 architecture with minimal alterations..
